Final Hierarchical Design
Tables:
TBL_Difference

Columns:
differenceId: Primary key.
differenceName: Name of the difference.
differenceCategory: Category (e.g., Gaap to Stat, Stat to Tax, NOL).
differenceTiming: Timing (e.g., Permanent, Temporary).
TBL_OTP_DIFFERENCE_MAPPING

Columns:
mappingId: Primary key.
otpCode: OTP code.
differenceId: Foreign key referencing TBL_Difference.
TBL_Balance

Columns:
balanceId: Primary key.
differenceId: Foreign key referencing TBL_Difference.
amount: Amount associated with the differenceId.
TBL_Hierarchy

Columns:
hierarchyId: Primary key.
parentId: Foreign key referencing TBL_Hierarchy for parent-child relationships.
differenceId: Foreign key referencing TBL_Difference.
level: Indicates the level in the hierarchy (1 for Category, 2 for Timing, etc.).
sequenceOrder: Defines the order within the same level.

Key Features of the Design:
Flexible Hierarchy: The TBL_Hierarchy structure allows for a flexible and scalable hierarchy that can be easily adjusted as needed.
Cumulative Aggregation: The sums at each level aggregate the amounts from all child levels, including cumulative sums at the top level (Level 1).
Clear Sorting: The final output is sorted by category, timing, otpCode, and differenceName, providing a structured and easy-to-read hierarchy.
This design should serve your needs well for organizing, querying, and presenting hierarchical financial data or any other data with similar requirements. If any further adjustments or refinements are needed down the line, you can always revisit and fine-tune the setup.

If everything looks good, you can go ahead and implement this in your environment!
